to get rgb colors working on ubuntu18.04 under putty and tmux
   (see ubuntu version with `lsb_release -a`)

- set putty to use 'xterm-24bit' under connection/data/terminal-type-string
- use the tmux.conf in this directory, or at least these lines:

   set -g default-terminal "xterm-24bit"
   set -as terminal-overrides ",xterm-24bit:Tc"

-  run: `tic -x -o ~/.terminfo xterm-24bit.terminfo`
