#+title: michal's emacs config
#+author: michal j wallace
#+date: 11-Oct-2019

# This file is auto-tangled and compiled by init.el each time emacs starts.

* bootstrap ~use-package~

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
; and use-package, which lets us load them dynamically
(eval-when-compile
  (require 'use-package))
#+end_src

* keep customize from modifying my hand-built config:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
; customize should load/save interactive variables from here:
(setq custom-file (concat mjw-cfg-root "custom.el"))
(when (file-exists-p custom-file)
  (load custom-file))
#+end_src

* remember recent files across emacs sessions.
This is just really handy to have near the top, so if something goes wrong, I can find the config file again.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package session
    :ensure t
    :init (session-initialize))
#+end_src

* basic window appearance
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq inhibit-startup-screen 1)
(tool-bar-mode -1)
(menu-bar-mode -1)
(scroll-bar-mode -1)
(set-frame-font "Consolas 12" nil t)

(global-visual-line-mode t) ; word wrap

(set-background-color "#112")
(set-foreground-color "#ddd")
(set-cursor-color "gold")

#+end_src

* ergonomics
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defalias 'yes-or-no-p 'y-or-n-p)
(setq ring-bell-function 'ignore)
#+end_src

* key bindings
** have c-x c-b bring up a nicer buffer list:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "\C-x \C-b") 'ibuffer)
#+end_src
** alt-9 and alt-0 to cycle through pages marked by ^L
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun forward-screen ()
  "move to the next page, showing only what's beetween the  (form feed) characters"
  (interactive)
  (widen)
  (forward-page)
  (narrow-to-page))

(defun backward-screen ()
  "move to the previous page, showing only what's beetween the  (form feed) characters"
 (interactive)
 (widen)
 (backward-page 2)
 (narrow-to-page))

(global-set-key "\M-9" 'backward-screen)
(global-set-key "\M-0" 'forward-screen)
#+end_src

** save and copy buffer to clipboard on f9
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (defun save-and-copy ()
    (interactive)
    (save-buffer)
    (save-excursion
      ; the next three lines are really mark-whole-buffer
      ; but using it in a function makes emacs give an
      ; annoying warning every time the config loads at startup
      (push-mark)
      (push-mark (point-max) nil t)
      (goto-char (minibuffer-prompt-end)))
    (copy-region-as-kill 0 0 1))

  (global-set-key [f9] 'save-and-copy)
#+end_src
