# retro uses launchpad/bzr and github won't accept the official
# retro history because of a mal-formed address.
#
# i don't have a good answer to this at the moment, but it's
# easy enough to just maintain a snapshot

# git clone https://code.google.com/p/retro-language/ 
# rsync -avd --delete --exclude .git retro-language/ ~/vrx
